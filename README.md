# sahl

a statically typed, bytecode based, programming language

## meaning

sahl means easy. This is the easiest statically typed language I could come up with.

## features

- statically typed
- channels with threads
- merge sort 3x slow than that written in python :(

## weird stuff

- in rust vm arrays are passed by reference unless they are being passed to a thread
- in c vm arrays are passed by reference and there are no threads
- c vm is working better than before but still has bugs / memory leaks / double frees

## todo

- add tuples
- add structs and enums
- add a standard library
- add a module system
- make it self hosted :)
- make it atleast as fast as python

## undecided

- closures
- garbage collection
